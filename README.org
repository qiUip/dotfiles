# dotfiles
A collection of my personal dotfiles. I keep this repository predominantly to
backup and sync my settings between various machines. The majority of the
scripts, functions etc. throughout these dotfiles where found in different
sources around the web. I have randomly picked up stuff I found useful and never
kept a track record of what came from where. Chances are, if anything looks
pretty good than it wasn't me who wrote it and credit is due elsewhere!

The directories containing the configuration files could be symlink into
'/\slash{}home\slash{}<username>\slash{}.config/', while files in the scripts
directory are symlink to '/\slash{}home\slash{}<username>\slash{}.scripts/'. I
use most of these configuration files more as templates as I run them across
multiple machines, each with some specific settings. As such, some minor errors
might appear and there will be some modification required to get all features to
work. Never-the-less it should be fairly easy to get these files to work in
case they do not. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you encounter any such
difficulty.o

For starters, only .config/i3 and .config/polybar were included, with additional
dotfiles to eventually follow.

Added: dunset, picom, vis (cli-visualiser), rofi, termite and zathura.
